# NOTE: The 'NASWI_MPX_Y_Noisemap - Flight Operations.xml' files have been exported from the corresponding .baseops case via BaseOps, where X is the monitoring period and Y is the file number (for Ault Field; Coupeville doesn't have this). These exports have been copied over to 'data/Noise Modeling Data/Exports/MP1', then opened in MS Excel, and saved as the .csv files used here.
