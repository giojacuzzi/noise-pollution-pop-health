p0 = 2*10^(-5)  # Reference sound pressure in Pascals (Pa) in air 20 Î¼Pa

# Acoustic pressure (Pa) to sound pressure level (dB)
pressureToSpl = function(p) {

  p0*10^(l/20)

# Leq is the equivalent continuous sound pressure level, also known as the "time-averaged sound pressure level". This is the steady-state sound pressure level which, over a given period of time (t_start to t_end), has the same total acoustic energy as the actual fluctuating noise signal (L). In other words, the RMS sound level with the measurement duration used as the averaging time.

# Calculate total Leq from level series over given time period (ISO 1996, Navy Technical Report)

  duration = t_end - t_start + 1

}

# The sound exposure level, SEL (also referred to as LE), of a noise event is the entire event's total sound energy normalized to a constant reference time interval, typically one second. When applied to single event the SEL is called "single-event sound exposure level". SEL can be used to compare the energy of noise events which have different time durations.

# Calculate SEL from Leq of identical time period	
SelFromLeq = function(Leq, duration) {
  Leq + 10*log10(duration) # Leq plus 10 times the log of the duration over 1 second)

  10*log10(sum(splToPressure(L)^2) / p0^2)

# Exceedance levels (Lx) represent the percent of the time that was measured above a certain level. For example, an L50 of 44 dB means that for 50% of the time, the level exceeded 44 dB.

# Calculate exceedance for the given percentage of time (0-100)
