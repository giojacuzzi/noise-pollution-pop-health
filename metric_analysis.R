# Acoustic pressure (Pa) to sound pressure level (dB)

# Leq is the equivalent continuous sound pressure level, also known as the "time-averaged sound pressure level". This is the steady-state sound pressure level which, over a given period of time (t_start to t_end), has the same total acoustic energy as the actual fluctuating noise signal (L). In other words, the RMS sound level with the measurement duration used as the averaging time.

# Calculate total Leq from level series over given time period (ISO 1996, Navy Technical Report)

  duration = t_end - t_start + 1

}

# The sound exposure level, SEL (also referred to as LE), of a noise event is the entire event's total sound energy normalized to a constant reference time interval, typically one second. When applied to single event the SEL is called "single-event sound exposure level". SEL can be used to compare the energy of noise events which have different time durations.
