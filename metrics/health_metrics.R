# WHO - "For average noise exposure, the GDG strongly recommends reducing noise levels produced by aircraft below 45 dB Lden, as aircraft noise above this level is associated with adverse health effects." The U.S. EPA recommends an average 24-hr exposure limit of 55 DNL (dBA) to protect the public from all adverse effects on health and welfare in residential areas

# WHO - "For night noise exposure, the GDG strongly recommends reducing noise levels produced by aircraft during night time below 40 dB Lnight, as night-time aircraft noise above this level is associated with adverse effects on sleep."
lnight_impact_threshold = 40

# EPA - "EPA has determined that for purposes of hearing conservation alone, a level which is protected of that segment of the population at or below the 96th percentile will protect virtually the entire population. This level has been calculated to be an Leq of 70 dB of a 24-hour day."
